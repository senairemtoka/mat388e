    "### First of all I found the pitchfork reviews dataset but it only had the artist, album, genre, score, date, author, role, review, bnm, link, label, release year. But when I looked more and more I found that people had scraped data of these albums from Spotify giving some characteristics about the albums such as the danceability, energy, key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, liveness, valence and tempo. But this dataset didn't have the reviews. So I decided to merge these two and use that for my project, this made the dataset a little bit smaller but I think it will be more interesting this way. "
